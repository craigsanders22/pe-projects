		<p>It's going even better! Today we are making 4 simple HTML pages and connecting them together. In reality, it is nice to be thinking and writing out some things for the first time in a few years. When I am in a good place -- mentally, with sleep, and with comforts -- I truly love writing. This practice will be good for me, I am sure!</p>
