## Joseph

### site-wide


1. Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at user/projects/e4p ?

- They were front and center on the home page, so easy to find, but not quite what I expected. They were not at projects/e4p/form.php, but php-practice/form.php instead




2. How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?

- The index page for the forms themselves doesn't exist, but the main landing page is very simple and easy to find what you need



3. Does it match the rest of the site?

- Doesn't really apply, since it is kind of all one page at the moment. 


### forms

(SELF CHECKOUT)

4. How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do? (imagine a grandparent is trying to use it)

- THe storytelling is great and pretty engaging. It explains how strange the whole thing is and kind of acknowledges the elephant in the room. 


5. Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?

- Buttons are pretty legible, the only thing I am thinking could be more clear is that the "how much is... " could have an indicator of the currency type to make sure that is known by the user


6. Does the form work with the expected input?

- Yes, it worked as expected 

7. Can you break it by putting in other values like 0 and empty?

- The only thing that worked that shouldn't have is putting "0" in all of the fields. 


8. Do things jump around when you interact with them?

- Everything worked well


9. Is the outcome clear?

- Yes, it is pretty clear. Something that could be added is a subtotal for each item? But definitely not a big deal. 


10. Do the form styles match across all forms?

- Not really, but there is some consistency in bright colors and general look. They do not match each other or the home page, though. 


11. Is it a pleasure to use?

- Yes - I enjoyed using the forms. 


12. What could be improved?

- The Self Checkout form itself seems pretty good in a vaccuum, but gettin some visual cohesiveness between the forms and also to the rest of the site would probably be the best next step.

### site-wide


1. Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at user/projects/e4p ?

- Pretty easy to find. There wasn't a direct link to /projects/ on the home page, but looking at the page you could see some clues as to where to find what we were looking for




2. How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?

- Yep - pretty clear. 



3. Does it match the rest of the site?

- Definitely. I think the only thing (this is site-wide) is that the text size feels a bit small to me. 


### forms

### Character Counter

4. How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do? (imagine a grandparent is trying to use it)

- There isn't much of a story here, but it does say it will count your characters in a few places. The text box does prompt to have the phrase typed or pasted in. Some people might be confused by the word "character" so I think explaining that or how it might work would be helpful to some users. 


5. Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?

- Yep, seems pretty good. Everything is labelled. 


6. Does the form work with the expected input?

- Yes, it worked as expected 

7. Can you break it by putting in other values like 0 and empty?

- Nothing broke really, the only thing I could get it to do was submit with just a single space, but it does count all of the punctuation and spaces, so not a big suprise. 


8. Do things jump around when you interact with them?

- Everything worked well


9. Is the outcome clear?

- Yes, the outcome was clear. It repeated the phrase and gave a character count at the end. 


10. Do the form styles match across all forms?

- Yes, these were all matching


11. Is it a pleasure to use?

- For sure - everything worked and looked nice


12. What could be improved?

- The character count form in particular felt small in general. Some more space in the text box, a little more spacing between the text on the page, maybe some larger font would help it to look more professional.
