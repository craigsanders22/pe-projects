        <p>We're Danny and Brenda -- the DISNEY FREAKS! We took our kids to Disney World and Disneyland when they were younger and everyone had a great time. But, once we were empty nesters we couldn't wait to get back and enjoy it on our own. We're here to help you plan the best Disney trip of your life - without (or with) your kids!</p>

        <p>Once we bought into the Disney timeshare program in 2014, we decided to start sharing our adventures on Instagram with our channel <a href="https://www.instagram.com/disneyfreaks">@disneyfreaks</a> and that quickly gained a loyal following! If you were one of those early FREAKS followers, we can't thank you enough! We soon grew tired of flying and decided to just move our main residence on to Disney property in Florida and now are able to sleep in a gondola inside "its a small world." Our backs hurt most mornings, but it is so worth it!</p>

        <p> After we had such good results from our gondola suite, we decided to purchase a room inside The Haunted Mansion at DisneyLand. We rarely sleep when we're there, but the behind the scenes experience is unparalled! As you can see, we stop at nothing to get the best access and provide you with amazing insights into these parks!</p>

Or maybe you'd love an inside look at the rivers of funnel cake batter under the sidewalks at Disneyland? Or -- who can forget the time we discovered that the clouds at Disney Paris are ACTUALLY made of cotton candy? </p>
