	<h2 class='heading attention-voice'>About Saloon Candle Co. </h2>

	<p class='story'>We're a group of pals that decided we needed a scent or two to liven up our spaces at home. But, without florals and citrus dominating things. We connected our roots to the Wild West and the rustic, rich scents that were found back in those days. We landed on a group of notes that evoked a saloon - where supple leather, strong whiskey, pipe smoke, wood, and dry hay. We love these candles and know that you will, too!
