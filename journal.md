# My Learning Journal

A daily worksheet for my DFTW journey. 


## August 1

### standup 


yesterday - did the HTML/CSS for the layout project. I took a little time with it and made sure I thought through next steps before I dug into it so I could avoid the "trial and error" method that I've fallen into some in the past. It went well. I did it all in PHP and also worked through my mental block on the CSS voices. 

today - going to work on making some of the layout more accurate - mainly some header and footer things that I rushed over and knew I'd need to come back to. Then will do a little research on my theme ideas and settle on something and dig a bit more into that. Trying to stay ahead a bit here as the rest of my week is a little hectic.
