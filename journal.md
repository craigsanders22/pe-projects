# My Learning Journal

A daily worksheet for my DFTW journey. 


## July 13

### standup 

yesterday - worked through the lesson and practiced some of the concepts, but was having trouble staying focused. Worked on getting my personal site closer to functioning right while making sure it is cohesive. Read some about PHP in a book I snagged at the library

today - heading in to do todays lesson now. I'm hoping to chip away at my personal site some more, and do another thing or two for the responsive layout garden. 

TO DO: 
[] lesson 102
[] layout garden
[] personal site - build additional pages + style + add images/icons?
