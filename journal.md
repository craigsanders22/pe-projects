# My Learning Journal

A daily worksheet for my DFTW journey. 


## July 12

### standup 

yesterday - did some extra work on PHP from Monday. Went through lesson 100 - made a little functioning if/else which was fun. Met with Derek and reviewed a bit and came up with some priorities over the next few weeks. Worked on making sure my personal site functioned correctly (links, replace filler images, etc.)

today - heading in to do todays lesson, planning to do a couple extra exercises in the responsive layout garden and work a bit more on my personal site. Also considering making some improvements to the Alpha 7 landing page? I cringe every time I open it, so it's time.  

TO DO: 
[] lesson 101
[] watch video/work through ?'s aboout personal site



### questions 

- [x] leave MAMP running?
- [x] package - php syntax checker? 




## conclusion
I made a php page that generated a random inventory number and based on the number (negative or positive) offered a link to order the item or gave a SOLD OUT message.
