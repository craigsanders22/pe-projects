# My Learning Journal

A daily worksheet for my DFTW journey. 


## August 2

### standup


Weekend - spent a lot less time on PE stuff than I anticipated. I did get a few random chunks of time to work on things but wasn’t super happy with my productivity. I updated PHP on my personal site, got my projects page looking and acting better, and did a mock-up of the CSS tricks website for some practice. I’m still having a little bit of a hard time dealing with multiple layers when doing PHP, so I need to work that out.                  

 
today - I did some things early this morning - worked on my site some, and have WP set up. Going back in for a bit now to see if I can finish out the lesson. I’m pretty constrained on time until school starts on Thursday. But really ready to get back into a routine here soon.
