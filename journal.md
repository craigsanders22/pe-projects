# My Learning Journal

A daily worksheet for my DFTW journey. 


## July 18

### standup 


yesterday - watched the video, then did the simple math exercise to practice the lesson. Worked some on a personal project, set up my goals page and got it (mostly) cohesive with my landing page. Studied a bit of PHP. 

today - heading in to do the lesson/practice for the day. Planning to do some extra work today to keep nailing this stuff down. Will go back and make an adjustment to what I did yesterday (keep numbers in form after submitting), and then hoping to get html/php set up for my resume page. 



TO DO:
