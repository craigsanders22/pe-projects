# My Learning Journal

A daily worksheet for my DFTW journey. 


## July 14

### standup 

yesterday - ended up having a rough day. I havent been sleeping well and it caught up to me. I got through the lesson and started to build the monster module, but just couldn't get through it. I decided I needed to get outside so I took my daughter on a long trail bike ride. Caught my pedal on a tree root and banged up my ankle trying to catch myself/my bike. Seems like just a sprain but not the most fun.  Hoped to come back in the evening but never did... 

today - fingers crossed - I have a lot of time today to focus on everything here. Going to go finish things from yesterday, then look at today. I really need to prioritize my personal site and getting it cohesive and just in a good spot, so that is how I hope to spend the rest of the day. I should be available for the team meeting but may just listen in or pop in and out if I'm in the zone on the other things I need to get done...
