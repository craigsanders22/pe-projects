# My Learning Journal

A daily worksheet for my DFTW journey. 


## August 2

### standup 


yesterday - researched candle websites, took a bunch of screenshots, compiled notes, made some visual boards to pick up on themes. Met with Derek. Went ahead and made a couple style tiles.

today - I've got my daughter with me all day, so I made a couple style tiles last night to try and stay ahead a touch. Going to go post those now, see if I get any feedback, and make another one or two later. I haven't watched the videos for todays lesson, so I'll watch those at some point today and use that to inform another iteration, as well. That's probably all I'll have time for if I'm realistic!
