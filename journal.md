# My Learning Journal

A daily worksheet for my DFTW journey. 


## August 2

### standup 


yesterday - spent some time getting the HTML/CSS closer to the example. Tried to clean up my code as much as possible. Researched some ideas for themes and settled on the manly candle. Didn't like what I saw with my initial research but ended up leaning more toward "high end" companies and found what is more in line with what I was thinking. 

today - I've watched the videos from the lesson today, found 3-4 sites and pulled a bunch of screenshots. Going to do a bit of looking through those and writing some things up now but then will need to come back later to finish. Need to try to meet with Derek today, too.
