A daily worksheet for my DFTW journey.

### standup 

Hello! Didn't get much time at the computer yesterday and never did my standup so doing a video standup today to make up for that '
yesterday/weekend - worked on my personal site a good amount Friday and Saturday. It is getting there from a visual perspective but need to clean the code up and try to get using some of the new concepts we've learned. Yesterday I got the exercises for programmers book and read the first chapter. Spent some time thinking through the process. I intended to come back and practice some PHP stuff in the evening but our power went out and it was out until nearly midnight so my night was a loss.

today - heading in to do the lesson for today. Then I'm going to go back and review a couple lessons that I kind of skimmed over - I think I only got about halfway through Friday's lesson, so definitely want to make sure I understand that. Might meet with Derek if he doesn't want to postpone our weekly. I was listening to Chris Coyers podcast this morning and it had an interesting little section that I am going to ask about below. Hope everyone has a good day!
