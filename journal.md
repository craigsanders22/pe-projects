# My Learning Journal

A daily worksheet for my DFTW journey. 


## August 2

### standup 


yesterday - didn't get much done. Worked with style tiles a bit more, reviewed the code for the challenge, but otherwise took my kid outside for the day. We found a huge geode and did a bunch of creek stomping. Reviewed what I missed last night and started a new style tile. 

today - I sent the family out for a few hours and I'm hoping to finish up the better style tile and get going on the CSS. I'm hoping to get 3ish hours today and the same tomorrow, but more would be better I'm guessing.
