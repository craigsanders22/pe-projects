		 <p> Every <?=$month?> <?=$number?> we always have a picnic at <?=$place?>  We invite <?=$nounOne?> and <?=$nounTwo?>. It is next to a very <?=$adjectiveOne?> lake. </p>
			

		<p> We have to walk <?=$adverbOne?> to get there without <?=$verbOne?>. There are <?=$animalOne?> and <?=$animalTwo?> which are very <?=$adjectiveTwo?>. We eat lots of food that everyone <?=$adjectiveThree?>. The games are my favorite part.</p>

		<p>We play <?=$verbTwo?>ing and <?=$verbThree?>ing until we canâ€™t walk anymore. Then we <?=$verbFour?> back and relax under the old shade tree until <?=$nounOne?>says, Happy Birthday!</p>"
