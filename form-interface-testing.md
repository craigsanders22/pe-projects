### site-wide


1. Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at user/projects/e4p ?






How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? Are the links clear?
Does it match the rest of the site?
Then â€“ per form:
How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do? (imagine a grandparent is trying to use it)
Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
Does the form work with the expected input?
Can you break it by putting in other values like 0 and empty?
Do things jump around when you interact with them?
Is the outcome clear?
Do the form styles match across all forms?
Is it a pleasure to use?
What could be improved?
