   <h1>GOALS</h1>

      <h2>June 2023</h2>

        <p>As we head into July of 2023, I’m looking forward to a summer filled with hard work, time with family, vacations, and learning more about the world of design and web development. My goals for the month of July are to rebuild a solid daily routine - biking daily, getting back to eating cleanly, tidying the house every day, getting all of my PE projects done on time and with the appropriate attention given to them, and getting back into a routine of reading and immersing myself in the environment of design - reading, studying the outside world, talking with people about their experiences, networking, and creating a portfolio of work to help me to be hirable at the end of the course. </p>


    <h2>End of Course/This Year</h2>

        <p>By the end of the year, I will be finishing up with the DFTW course and be comfortable with the tools needed to find and excel at a web design + build job.  I’ll have knowledge and experience with HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, design concepts, typography, working sustainably, and interacting in the workplace. I will be searching for jobs with agencies in the local market as well as remote opportunities. The positions I will be a fit for will offer an environment to allow me to use my current skills and talents while learning new things and being challenged. It will be a welcoming and flexible work culture. It will pay me appropriately while offering the opportunity for advancement within the business (or make me valuable to transition to another company in the future). I’ll be able to prioritize time with my family, give me space to continue to focus on my mental and physical health and provide a place to collaborate and feel at home. I won’t take work “home” with me unless I choose to. </p>


    <h2>Five years</h2>

        <p>I wake up somewhere comforting and beautiful. The windows are open. My little family is happy, and our needs are taken care of. We work hard, but not too much. I have started freelancing in web design which is rewarding - both financially and in non-tangible ways.  I am prideful of the work I am producing, and clients are, too. I have a steady stream of clients that I enjoy working with. If I am blessed enough to have more opportunities than I need - I choose the clients that I am inspired by. As I build that freelancing business, I have taken on some more roles that I am comfortable with to support clients better - perhaps some branding, marketing materials, copywriting, accessibility, etc. I will focus on small to medium-sized businesses that depend on their online presence to increase revenues. I will take on non-profits, ideally some that can pay for my services, but also some that need my work as a donation. I will be able to do that willingly and joyfully. </p>

        <p>My wife is working less than she does right now. We plan 3-4 vacations a year to visit National Parks, places of personal interest, and overseas destinations. I am able to disconnect entirely during those times, and my clients understand and respect those boundaries. We are financially stable and saving for retirement. Our daughter continues to excel in school, and we can challenge and support her with a quality education and experiences in the world. </p>

        <p>We will enjoy time with family, living a measured and calm life with beautiful things around us and the bandwidth to enjoy them. We will be savoring the moments. We will take walks in the woods and on the beach. We’ll drink good wine and eat good food. We’ll be healthy and looking forward to the future… what will ten years bring? </p>
