            <p class="calm-voice">We're heading into fall - my favorite time of year! I'll be drinking lots of coffee with maple syrup and vanilla, eating my weights worth in apples, taking drives with the windows down so we can smell the drying leaves and crops, and enjoying some cozy fires outside! </p>
            <p class="calm-voice">Beyond that, I'm looking forward to some really great modules in Design for the Web. We'll be getting comfortable with JavaScript and applying it to a range of applications. I'm going to be reaching out to a few potential mentors, others in the tech field, and some potential employers to build my network and knowledge of the market I'm getting ready to head into. I'll be doing some brainstorming to determine what our priorities will be in my job search and how to achieve some of the things we are looking forward to in the next phase of life.</p>

            <p class="calm-voice">By the beginning of next year, I will be finishing up with the DFTW course and be comfortable with the tools needed to find and excel at a web design + build job.  I’ll have knowledge and experience with HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, JavaScript, Vue, design concepts, typography, working sustainably, and interacting in the workplace.</p>

              <p class="calm-voice">I will be searching for jobs with agencies in the local market as well as remote opportunities. The positions I will be a fit for will offer an environment to allow me to use my current skills and talents while learning new things and being challenged. It will be a welcoming and flexible work culture. It will pay me appropriately while offering the opportunity for advancement within the business (or make me valuable to transition to another company in the future). I’ll be able to prioritize time with my family, give myself space to continue to focus on my mental and physical health and provide a place to collaborate and feel at home. I won’t take work “home” with me unless I choose to. </p>

            <p class="calm-voice"> My little family is happy, and our needs are taken care of. We work hard, but not too much. I might have started freelancing in web design which is rewarding - both financially and in non-tangible ways.  I am prideful of the work I am producing, and clients are, too. I have a steady stream of clients that I enjoy working with. If I am blessed enough to have more opportunities than I need - I choose the clients that I am inspired by. As I build that freelancing business, I have taken on some more roles that I am comfortable with to support clients better - perhaps some branding, marketing materials, copywriting, accessibility, etc. I will focus on small to medium-sized businesses that depend on their online presence to increase revenues. I will take on non-profits, ideally some that can pay for my services, but also some that need my work as a donation. I will be able to do that willingly and joyfully.</p>

            <p class="calm-voice">My wife is working less than she does right now. We plan 3-4 vacations a year to visit National Parks, places of personal interest, and overseas destinations. I am able to disconnect entirely during those times, and my clients understand and respect those boundaries. We are financially stable and saving plenty for retirement. Our daughter continues to excel in school, and we can challenge and support her with a quality education and experiences in the world.</p>

            <p class="calm-voice">We will enjoy time with family, living a measured and calm life with beautiful things around us and the bandwidth to enjoy them. We will be savoring the moments. We will take walks in the woods and on the beach. We’ll drink good wine and eat good food. We’ll be healthy and looking forward to the future.</p>
